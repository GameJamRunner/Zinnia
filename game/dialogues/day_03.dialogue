Irina: Irina~~~ it’s Saturday morning~~~
Irina: Are you awake?
Irina: Hey, don’t tell me you’re still in bed.
Irina: …
Irina: Okay, if you’re asleep, I’ll be patient.

narrator: I sighed, putting my phone down. 
narrator: I was feeling a little impatient with Aria, but honestly, it was probably for the best. 
narrator: I had an exam coming up and hadn’t even started studying.
narrator: Talking to her always took so much time, and right now, I didn’t have any to spare—or at least, that’s what I told myself.
narrator: I’ll get back to her later when I had more time.

time: 3:15 PM

Aria: Irina…?
Aria: It’s the afternoon.

narrator: I stared at the screen, feeling a pang of guilt. 
The morning had slipped away, and I still hadn’t opened my notes. 
Instead, I had been watching random YouTube videos all morning. 
narrator: Should I reply? Or should I focus and study.

Aria: Hey… are you okay?
Aria: Did I do something wrong?
Aria: If you don’t want to talk to me anymore, just tell me. I can take it.
Aria: But it hurts more when you just ignore me like this.
Aria: I thought we were friends.

narrator: Her messages piled up, each one heavier than the last. 
narrator: My chest tightened as I read them. She sounded hurt—more than I expected.

Aria: Please just say something. Even if it’s just “leave me alone.”
