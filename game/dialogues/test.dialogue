Aria: u there?
Aria: ?
Aria: Irina

narrator: It was a quiet evening when Aria messaged me out of nowhere. 
narrator: We hadn’t spoken much since high school, and seeing her name pop up felt strange—almost nostalgic.

- keep it casual
	Irina: hi… what’s up?
	Aria: just glad we ran into each other again. haven’t seen u since prom.
	Irina: oh, yeah… it’s been a while. good to hear from u.
- be friendly
	Irina: hey! it’s been forever, hasn’t it?
	Aria: I know, right? just glad we ran into each other again. prom feels like ages ago.
	Irina: yeah, it really does. I missed talking to u!
- stay guarded
	Irina: hi… didn’t expect to hear from u.
	Aria: yeah, I wasn’t sure if I should message u, but I’m glad we ran into each other again.
	Irina: uh-huh. so, what’s up?
	Aria: just glad we ran into each other again. haven’t seen u since prom.
	Irina: um… ok… yeah, same. just didn’t really know what to say to u.
	Aria: Irina… I just wanna be nice, that’s all.

narrator: The tone shifted, and I couldn’t help but tease her.
